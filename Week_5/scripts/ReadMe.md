This folder contains three scripts referenced and used in the Week_5 ReadMe file.

These scripts are:

get_genome.sh: Downloads FASTA and GFF files for a provided accession number and prepares them for use. <br>

genome_stats.sh: Generates the genome length, feature amount, and longest gene for a given set of FASTA and GFF files. <br>

get_fastq.sh: Downloads a subset of a paired end FASTQ file, runs basic statistics on the FASTQ file, and runs FASTQC to assess sequence quality. <br>

get_fastq_Nanopore.sh: Downloads a subset of a single end FASTQ file, runs basics statistics on the FASTQ file, and runs FASTQC to assess sequence quality. This code is better optimized for Oxford Nanopore platforms.
